I'm always on the look out for novel ideas, so this is a list of some
"competitors" or alternatives to paste.qaaq.cc.


Encrypted:
  - PrivateBin: https://privatebin.info (self hosted, many installs)
    Uses AES-256 GCM (good)
    - e.g.: https://bin.disroot.org
  - 0bin (https://github.com/Tygs/0bin)
    - e.g. https://paste.ec
  - https://paste.me
    Not fully open source, but has a WASM Go component: https://github.com/pastemeofficial/pasteme-wasm
    (interesting idea, but crypto.subtle supports AES-GCM, so unsure if it's really needed...)
  - https://github.com/WardPearce/paaster
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1116d9c/paaster_v2_endtoend_encrypted_pastebin/
    - Strange design choices, can't just type in it.
  - https://github.com/matze/wastebin (optional encryption, argon2, etc...)
  - https://hemmelig.app/ (secret link sharing, one time use)
    - Also things like https://onetimesecret.com/
    - More open source variants...
      - https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt
      - https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/
      - https://www.privacyprotect.dev/

(Note paste.qaaq.cc isn't using AES-GCM but AES-CBC with a custom authentication, this is for compatibility with the OpenSSL command line tool which doesn't support GCM: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/21142)


SSH based:
  - snips.sh
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/13fyp1k/snipssh_passwordless_anonymous_sshpowered_pastebin/
    - https://github.com/robherley/snips.sh
    - https://snips.sh/docs/self-hosting.md
  - pastes.sh
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/18x8z7s/pastessh_a_pastebin_for_hackers/


"curl" API:
  - 0x0.st
    - Open source: https://github.com/mia-0/0x0
  - paste.rs
  - ix.io ðŸª¦
    https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/189t2wm/will_the_pastebin_alternative_ixio_stay_down/


Minimal design:
  - bin. (https://github.com/w4/bin)
    - e.g. https://bin.gy
  - bin (https://github.com/wantguns/bin)
    - e.g.: https://basedbin.fly.dev/


Syntax highlighting:
  - https://gist.github.com
  - https://microbin.eu/ (open source, self hostable)
  - https://github.com/lojewalo/paste
    - e.g. https://paste.gg
  - Ghostbin (https://github.com/DHowett/spectre, now archived)
    - I liked the minimal, full screen UI, very paste.qaaq.cc style.
    - e.g.: https://pst.innomi.net

Markdown support:

  [many others...]


Classic:
  - https://pastebin.com -- the OG[?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin has citation needed)
  - http://pastie.org
  [many others...]
